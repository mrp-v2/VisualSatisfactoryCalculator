1. Make numbers minimum rate based
    - [x] Normal connections
    - [ ] Fixed Rate connections
        - might need to change how multi-connections work
        - try delaying abnormal connection processing until after processing all reachable normal connections, then see which attached nodes haven't been updated and work from there
            - do multi-connections that have only one non-updated step first, to see if that fills in other multi-connections
        - maybe have a popup happen to let the user decide what happens if there are multiple options the program could do
        - process multi-connections in order of complexity (how many nodes are connected), and in order of which ones are easy to adjust
        - cases
            - [ ] All consumers updated, and remaining producers to be updated, or vice versa
                - if multiple remaining to be updated, prompt user for distribution 
            - [ ] Remaining producers and consumers to be updates
                - reduce/increase either overall consumption or production or both
                    - probably ask the user, and give them some button to press for only evenly distributing change to either producers or consumer. otherwise let them adjust sliders or something manually
            - [ ] All producers and consumers updated
                - verify rates are equal, if not, add a orphaned consumer/producer and prompt user about extra/deficient rate
            - when prompting user, add a 'remember this decision for this connection' checkbox for buttons / simple actions?
2. Convert to Factorio
    - [ ] user inputs
        - [ ] machine tier
        - [ ] machine count interval (can specify # of machines must be a multiple of a number n)
        - [ ] max number of beacons per machine (for machines not at start or end)
        - [ ] beacon falloff behavior
            - [ ] edge beacon bonus (bonus for machines within interval of start or end)
            - [ ] edge bonus falloff rate (how fast the start or end bonus goes down with each interval farther from the start or end)
        - [ ] modules available
        - [ ] priority order of productivity, power consumption, and speed/machine count
