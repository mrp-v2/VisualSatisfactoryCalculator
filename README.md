# VisualSatisfactoryCalculator

This program is a Windows Forms Application to help you create 'perfect' production lines in Satisfactory.
This program was designed with the intent of giving the user as much control as possible over their production line.

Production lines can be saved to a png image, and then loaded at a later time for further editing.
Saving a production line to an image uses digital stenography, so loading an image that has been edited since it was saved will probably not work.

Uses code from https://github.com/Goz3rr/SatisfactorySaveEditor to load a save and figure out what recipes are unlocked.
